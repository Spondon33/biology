  <h1 id="topic">Phylum Classification</h1>

  <h2 id="ques1">What is Phylum?</h2>

    <h2 id="ans1">In biology, a phylum is a level of classification or taxonomic rank
      below kingdom and above class. Traditionally, in botany the term division has been
      used instead of phylum, although the International Code of Nomenclature for
      algae, fungi, and plants accepts the terms as equivalent. Depending on definitions,
      the animal kingdom Animalia contains approximately 31 phyla; the plant kingdom Plantae
      contains about 14, and the fungus kingdom Fungi contains about 8 phyla. Current
      research in phylogenetics is uncovering the relationships between phyla,
      which are contained in larger clades, like Ecdysozoa and Embryophyta.</h2>

    <h2 id="ques2">The major among Phylum:</h2>

    <li>Nematoda</li>
    <li>Mollusca</li>
    <li>Annelida</li>

  </ul>

    <h1 id="porifera">Porifera :</h1>

    <h2 id="poriferaDef">Sponges, the members of the phylum Porifera are a basal animal clade as a sister of the Diploblasts.
    They are multicellular organisms that have bodies full of pores and channels allowing
    water to circulate through them, consisting of jelly-like mesohyl sandwiched between
    two thin layers of cells. The branch of zoology that studies sponges is known as spongiology.
